			<section>
				<p>I've been focused on baseball lately. Learning a lot, researching, discovering the history behind the sport and, what I had found the most fun, getting my hands on some datasets of baseball statistics and other resources to aid the frenzy. I even toyed with the idea of making a whole new website to host some of my articles and findings early, starting now,, but my research work is very young at this point and is just not enough material and organization to even consider the trouble of making a new website right now, although that is actually one of the future plans. First, I need to build a good corpus of researched stuff, find a rhythm that suits me and, most importantly, find from within baseball what it is that I want to focus on and just dive head first into the information ocean out there. It's exciting.</p>
				<p>Keeping the baseball topic: The MLB World Series is undergoing right now. Game two between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees just happened. The Dodgers won 4-2 (they also won game one with a score 6-3), and just like game one, I got a chance to see possibly the best game of modern baseball I've seen so far. Both games have lived up to the hype build around them. The first game ended with a walk-off grand slam from Dodger's Freddie Freeman, it was the most amazing sight I had of the 2024 season so far. And today, Dodger's Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched to get only one hit across 6 â…“ innings, looking nearly unhittable to get Dodgers a two-game advantage. Just another great, amazing game I was able to witness. I am looking forward to next week and the rest of the World Series. I'd like to see Los Angeles win this one. The Yankees have had enough. Either way, this will turn up to be one of the best matchups in baseball history, I am shure.</p>
				<p>Two good and exciting plans are getting closer: first I'll get to go to dance and vibe to some good electronic music in the Boileroom that will happen in my city. I was invited (my uncle paid for the tickets), and it was an opportunity that I wouldn't let pass for no reason. Next, I'll start making my plans and reservations for the Taxco weekend I have been craving for some time now. Ideally, I'll find room for the trip before christmas, but I need to take care of the economics first. Shouldn't be a problem. I specifically chose Taxco out of my memory because I was there one time before, and it was a blast. I know it was my company, though, but the place holds so much magic and good memories that I need to go one more time and just take all that in again, and take the opportunity to snap some cool recent pictures of the place, write something there and get a local newspaper as a souvenir.. Also, I want to buy myself a present, so I just might use the trip and grab some silver for myself. Who knows? Only thing I am sure about is that it's going to be fun.</p>
