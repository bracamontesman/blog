				<p>Everything keeps going smoothly. I am starting to organize my schedule, not only for work time, but also for the free time slot that I now have and that needs to be allotted between this beautiful hobby and my ongoing education.</p>
				<p>The ONE program has moved now into the second phase, and I've been able to submit the required project on time to move on with the program. The eliminatory project is an "encryption tool" for simple text. It's not actually encryption in the technical sense, but more like a very easy word scrambler; anyway, it's been fun to make and has also proved to be really educational. The main goal is to showcase some knowledge and abilities required from us in order to move forward, like demonstrating we can come up with some simple logic to solve a given problem, that we can manage a project using the Agile principle in a Trello board, that we know how to use Git and GitHub, write commit messages, and deploy a project to the web; also that we can translate a simple Figma design into some pretty and useful CSS. Overall, they wanted to make sure that we are, at least, a little knowledgeable about front-end web development to be eligible.</p>
				<p>Once we were able to filter past this step, we were presented with a choice: either we continue specializing in front-end, deepening the studies on it, or we can choose back-end as a path for future education. In my specific case, choosing back-end was the main goal because this path holds a plethora of knowledge and education that is uncharted territory for me, so it represents the most opportunities to grow and learn. I am not going to lie: I was really tempted to choose the front-end path because I thought that, given the corpus of knowledge that I already have, it might get easier in the future. But going with what seems like the easiest option has proven to be a mistake for me in the past, so I've lost the fear of losing my comfort and decided to go with the new stuff. I'm excited about it, but I haven't started yet. So that is, in principle, why I need to get my agenda in order given that this is a self-paced program.</p>
				<p>Now, moving into the documentation process topic: it all remains the same. No improvements whatsoever; I'm still stuck in the difficulties of writing and recording. But this project is growing, and with that, new aspirations and ideas are coming. For instance, I am thinking (and planning) on using my newly created "movies" page to embark on a watching and writing experience. Not sure about how it needs to be done, but the first thought of it was to take a commitment with watching a series of movies (maybe even a whole filmography) and writing a regular series of publications about them. I saw on Mastodon a similar look and feel in a project called Stephen King Journey, but that one is about the books by the author. Taking some inspiration from what that person does, I wanted to do something kind of similar but doing the corpus of work of a specific movies director. Let's see what I decide to do and if it sticks.</p>
				<p>Damn, I really like a girl from my job. That's too damn unfortunate at the moment, because there is no way to get on her radar. But she's absolutely beautiful, so I might find joy in the sight alone.</p>
