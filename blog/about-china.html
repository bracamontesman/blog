				<p>China used to be one of the poorest countries in the world, overly dependent on the meager agrarian income they had, missing out on industrialization and trade opportunities. They underwent several reforms and changes to alter this situation, one of which is known as the “Great Leap Forward” during the Mao era. This social movement aimed to industrialize all agrarian China and increase grain yields for production. However, this is not an example of successful change, as history identifies the “Great Chinese Famine” as the result of these failed policies. Mao officials feared being labeled as rightist and counter-revolutionary, so they falsified numbers and reports to meet Mao’s exaggerated claims while leaving the population starving. At this point, they found that Maoism was not the answer, but they also knew that capitalism wasn't either.</p>
				<p>In the late 1970s, they once again attempted serious economic reforms aimed at loosening state control over economic productivity, leaning towards “market liberalism.” This new reform was initiated under new leadership that dismissed the previous administration’s ideologies (like Maoism and straight socialism) and instead introduced openness to markets. This led to their economic system being termed “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”</p>
				<p>“The purpose of the reform program was not to abandon communism but to make it work better by substantially increasing the role of market mechanisms in the system and by reducing—not eliminating—government planning and direct control. In the CCP's view, economic planning would be a mechanism for steering the market. Therefore, the CCP did not perceive its reforms as the foundation for a liberal market economy.”</p>
				<p>As a result of this new reform attempt, it's said that China has achieved the milestone of ending absolute poverty in the country, as Xi Jinping proposed as a goal upon taking office. The strategy focused on providing enhanced opportunities to the countryside, as they were the ones most affected by extreme poverty. This was purportedly achieved by 2020. However, some state-owned media have published that these alleviations need careful review to ensure sustainability since current strategies include simply handing out cash to people, which is not sustainable.</p>
				<p>With the reforms, China's economy grew and achieved a period of stability. The agricultural sector was opened up, allowing farmers to sell and trade surplus produce; private businesses were allowed to exist and even started competing with state-owned companies. It resembled a “liberalization” of China’s economy, appearing much like Western capitalism while still retaining some market participation and regulatory oversight.</p>
				<p>The CCP, however, does not refer to their system as “capitalist”; on the contrary, they double down on calling it “socialism.” This characterization stems from the heavy state presence in the market, where state-owned organizations still exert significant control over services and, in some cases, even monopolies. Since the Communist Party in China is the sole governing entity, with virtually no opposition, their hierarchy and members wield power through permits, authorizations, and administration, even over private companies. This kind of “ownership” through regulation and control is the essence of the “socialist” element within Chinese society. They all answer to the people through the administrative structure of the party.</p>
				<p>When we think of a communist country, we often immediately think of China. However, many opposing arguments assert that it's not a communist economy per se, as they participate in trade councils, have private companies trading on stock exchanges, and are selling products worldwide. Today, they boast the strongest economy, so many Chinese individuals are wealthy. This challenges the notion that “communism is bad,” at least economically speaking, presenting a significant counterexample. Value judgments aside, the extent of censorship and population control in China is a separate matter, best evaluated by the people themselves. But we cannot deny the astronomical growth of its economy.</p>
				<p>There's the existence of “Chinese soft power,” which means they will project themselves through narratives and information portraying China positively. This, along with the existence of the “Great Firewall of China” in charge of censorship and online control, makes all the information coming from within to be taken with a huge grain of salt since it can be “commie propaganda.” However, the actual propaganda remains strong within the global North and the imperialist media apparatus, as they double down on one bad while overseeing five goods. However, as I've discovered, it's actually like this: Western media fabricates consensus far more than a communist country and its “propaganda.” Communist China is subtle; they show rather than tell, and we are now inundated with their production, indicating significant growth, so...</p>
