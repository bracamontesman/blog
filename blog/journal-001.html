				<p>It's been an interesting couple of months. A lot has happened in my life, and thankfully, all of it has been positive and kept me moving forward. Since I'm not great at documenting things, I failed to keep track of these developments, so I don't have any records to look back on. This also includes the lack of photos or videos that everyone seems so keen on capturing these days. I'd like to say it's because I'm living in the moment, as the bohemians do, but that's not entirely true. The plain fact is that I don't have the photographer's instinct, and maybe not the writer's either. So, now that I can, here's my attempt to balance things out by actually writing something down:</p>
				<p>The first positive change: I've got a new job. It's a good one, comfortable because it's remote, and easy because it aligns naturally with my interests. I don't have to endure long hours of soul-crushing work; instead, it's engaging and enjoyable. I really hope this job continues to be as great as it seems so far (it actually looks amazing), and with that, the financial side of things is sorted for now, giving me more freedom to pursue bigger goals.</p>
				<p>The other big news is that I'm still pursuing my education. I got accepted into the Oracle Next Education program, which is like a scholarship provided by Oracle for students in my region who don't have clear opportunities for higher education in tech. This support comes in the form of a bootcamp designed to equip us with web development skills and industry best practices, enough to make us hireable by Oracle or other tech companies. The program's goal is to certify us and connect us with companies looking for junior talent with a solid tech stack. It's super cool and motivating; there's even a Discord server for social interactions among students and program staff, offering great opportunities for networking and discussion with like-minded people. Overall, it's a huge benefit.</p>
				<p>Finally, and this feels like an achievement, this project is still alive and well. No major overhauls, no sudden deletions since its creation. Believe it or not, that consistency is a big part of what keeps me feeling successful so far.</p>
