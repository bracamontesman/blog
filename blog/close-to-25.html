            <section>
                <p>I'm actually excited to be close to 2025, and I think this time is because “we have a new beginning,” as they say. And I am all for it.</p>
				<p>I'm excited for February, to begin with, because we will both be having anniversaries: my website and I. Getting to thirty-one is not quite the celebration because there's a lot left to achieve, and I am feeling the heat of age, but having my website live for a whole year, for the very first time in my life (even as a web developer), is a huge deal. It means I am getting better at conservation, measurement, and a whole lot of self-control. As I've written before, a ton of other websites, blogs, platforms, or whatnot were developed and written over the years, but they were brutally and completely nuked from existence when I got tired of them. That fact and the complete lack of other means of conservation started to get to me when I discovered that I, as a person, have been skipping opportunities to capture memories, the past, history, and ultimately existence. I've also been sentencing myself in the future to be absurdly empty-handed when trying to remember who I was in the past.</p>
				<p>I thoroughly enjoy whenever I get to read again stuff I've written over the years. It helps me reconnect with those old memories, moments, and ways of thinking. It also helps me put into perspective my personal growth, which has become one of my main topics in life. These moments of recalling my old self are only possible through the minimal pieces of evidence out there. There are few of those pieces, almost as if I am struggling to demonstrate that I exist. These types of feelings are far from being part of a hunger for fame or recognition, although I admit they look like that sometimes. If I were to guess, I'd say the fact that I decided to make all these notebooks and journal entries public is what gives that impression. But the real reason for all these texts being published on the internet is this technology's capacity to preserve stuff forever, which ultimately sounds like the best plan for this, at least to me. Keeping the past in a way I can visit it whenever, preferably in a way I like doing it: nothing more.</p>
				<p>Besides the constant fight of my life against the “conservation of memories,” I'd say I've been doing pretty well this year, specifically beginning the third Q24. I struggled a little at the beginning of the year by not having a steady job with a formal income. I got lost in the “my own boss” spiral and got nowhere during those years—not even moving forward with my education, which at the moment is actually free. But thankfully, I was able to make the sudden shift and started to put my life together once more. First, I got an amazing job aligned with stuff and concepts that I love, capable of solving, at the moment, my financial situation. After that, I started to get out of debt. I'm not one hundred percent there yet, but oh boy! I am way better than before—one and a half feet out of the water. I kept improving little by little old habits that I've been wanting to fight. I drink a lot more water than previously, and I recently started to activate myself physically by paying for a gym membership. Amazing moments right now. For the immediate future, there is some budgeting to do in order to start with those trips I want to make throughout my country, and it looks like January is, finally, the moment I need. I even got permission already for an absence on 01/03 to start traveling.</p>
				<p>The downsides have been so minimal that I'd rather not focus on remembering those for this piece. Nothing particularly bad is coming to mind, so no need to force it. I will keep growing, I will keep learning, and I will keep looking for opportunities. Hopefully, next year I'll be able to pursue my plans with full force, pursue more hands-on and technical education, and explore the “having a business with my knowledge” type of gig. Give it a try; there's nothing to lose. That's actually one of the biggies when talking about dreams and goals. So the path is paved for now; it is just a matter of grabbing those opportunities with faith and continuing to wake up. No need to be excellent today; it's just a matter of being better than I was yesterday</p>
