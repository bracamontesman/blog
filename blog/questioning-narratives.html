				<p>Russia and Ukraine are still at war. According to what I've read, there are two defining moments in the conflict: the beginning in 2014 with Russia's "annexation of Crimea" and, more recently, the "Russian invasion of Ukraine" in 2022.</p>
				<p>In the West, especially in political circles, there was a strong expression of rejection against Russia due to the coverage given to the "invasion" and the declaration of war, which, according to imperialist corporate propaganda, was deemed senseless. Simply hearing the news "war breaks out" convinced us that we were witnessing a brutal and exceptional act, unprecedented for some generations, shrouded in absolute malice and arbitrariness. It was easy for the population to take sides so quickly.</p>
				<p>The source of our political convictions, especially regarding geopolitics, is almost always news programs and opinion shows in corporate media. Practically everything we know about the world, or in other words, our version of reality, is entirely constructed through the discourse fed to us by corporate media. Even when certain information is sourced from the internet, many times, it's the same "news" corporations spreading their material online. Being on this platform does not guarantee independence from the publisher.</p>
				<p>We are accustomed to receiving without a hint of doubt what we are told, with slow (or completely absent) critical thinking and an expectant memory for a phrase that summarizes the information and is easily digestible. A headline, in other words. And the media knows it.</p>
				<p>This has led us into an epidemic of misinformation and communicative manipulation. The fact of having a single, immovable source of information, such as the news or the same journalist, places us at the end of a funnel whose content is the result of a conscious propaganda architecture that aims precisely to make us think in a certain way.</p>
				<p>So, what does the war in Ukraine have to do with this?</p>
				<p>If one accepts a critical perspective, we are obligated to question the truth of the "Russia is the villain" narrative. It should be obvious that this does not necessarily mean taking the opposite opinion but subjecting both arguments to the same doubt. However, very little is known about the Russian version of the issue. Without attempting somersaults or employing impossible defenses, I honestly believe that their version should be considered as a factor before taking sides, instead of reducing ourselves to reactive individuals easily swayed with war expressions and well-directed hatred.</p>
				<p>The purpose of questioning the information presented to us is to achieve, as far as possible, communicative democracy, and, even more importantly, freedom of thought. Anyone still denying the existence of the "big brother" is simply choosing the path of submission.</p>
				<p>It is no longer a hunch or a conspiratorial invention: large digital corporations (those involved in data harvesting) and many agencies in the service of imperialist governments use surveillance and espionage to subdue us through the manipulation of our realities and discourses. If they need to wage war for one reason or another, they can simply start their machinery of disinformation to scare us and align us. They make us "want" the things that benefit the power elite through the constant repetition of tailored speeches (very much like Goebbels). They seek to keep people in the numbing stupor of ignorance, thus avoiding any intellectual and revolutionary awakening of their peoples that may arise from frustration or social organization.</p>
				<p>That's why the question "are the Russians the bad guys?" is necessary because with this simple interruption of obedient behavior, we open ourselves to the possibility of criticizing the biased "journalism" that works for those in power. By questioning the news package offered to us, we can gain perspective on the true size of the landscape and move towards making better decisions once we have had access to all the information, with all the different perspectives available.</p>
				<p>In my country, perhaps the most urgent thing is for the population to become aware that these things happen, to prevent their thoughts from lingering in the comfortable ignorance of corporate reasons and settling for thinking, "why would they want to do this?" Precisely, it is this ignorance of the methods and their purposes that they seek to spread with their sensationalist publications lacking depth and critique. With their jokes, with their clowns and their lorets. With their cartoonists, with their "historians," and organic intellectuals. Having critical thinking turned off when we see that "our country is worse than ever" and that "the senseless war of the bad Russians" has broken out.</p>
				<p>We better wake up.</p>
