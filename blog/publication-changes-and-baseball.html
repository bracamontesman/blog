				<p><del>I decided to change my blog style to one that resembles a feed. I realized that having a folder full of HTML files somehow triggered some bad feelings in me. It feels like there's no real control once the folder gets into the hundreds of files, and when sorted alphabetically, they don't make much sense in terms of time (among other minor issues). Thinking that I'll reach the hundreds while counting my blog posts is pretty optimistic, but it's also something that's definitely reachable and needs to be addressed sooner or later. It's always better for me to be prepared for when the time comes rather than being negative about it and not having a plan for control and escalation.</del></p>
                <p><em>The previous statement is so wrong on so many levels that I feel the need to fully retract it.</em></p>
				<p>I started to pay attention to baseball. I mean, it's obviously something that's been around forever, but it's only now that my need to be a fan has really taken hold. I remember a lot of expressions and jargon related to the game, the voices of my local commentators (they've always been the same two) since I was a kid, and some names and little things here and there. There's a lot to learn when it comes to rules, plays, and statistics, but finding joy and fun in the next big thing to learn is what it's all about. Baseball is rich in documentation, websites, fan discussions, and public forums. Another advantage is that baseball is a big sport (not the biggest, but maybe second to soccer) in my country, so there are definitely plenty of opportunities to catch some live local games and experience the whole "ballpark vibe." That's in the plans as soon as the season begins.</p>
				<p>So far, I've been able to catch the last games of the regular MLB season, including the double-header between the Braves and the Mets to decide seeds five and six of the National League. Now, I'm looking forward to the wild card games that are about to start tomorrow. My region (and streaming platform of choice) will be offering Game Number One between the Orioles and the Royals, so I guess tomorrow they'll be my teams to watch, although my allegiance is starting to lean toward the Padres.</p>
				<p>Tomorrow, I'll be writing about my new glasses and shoes, and the experience that came with them.</p>
