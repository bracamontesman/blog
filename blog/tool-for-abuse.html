				<h2>Tool for abuse</h2>
				<time>2024-03-08</time>
				<p class="marginless"><em>About critical thinking, corporate surveillance, privacy and digital rights</em></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>There is a hard truth surrounding software, new computational technology, and its industry: it is, from its very core, privileged in principle and nefariously and systematically developed to be a tool for abuse. Even though there is hope for computers, servers, and networks to represent tools for freedom of speech and free communication rather than oppression, the current status of the situation is the exact opposite.</p>
				<p>It is evident that a significant group of Silicon Valley programmers and their bosses are fighting to bury the network's essence of privacy and freedom; instead, they are applying all capacities to fund capitalist companies, to hoard knowledge behind paywalls, and to make intellectual property claims. There is a developing culture among young technologists to beg for positions in companies that seek benefits even at the expense of human rights. And that 'reality' was imposed by the economic machine that turns everything (even development) into a product. Is that the future of the digital world?</p>
				<p>Instead of surrendering the digital arena, we must take it into our own hands and be present. Not be defeated and absent, full of antipathetic feelings inspired by the rotten status. We must transform the communities' convictions so new technology-for-profit companies lose a little power and relax the tight control they have in the market. Let's stay vigilant so it won't become the absolute eye and fist of oppression, as the corporate software developers are so eager to build.</p>
				<p>Free association and open-source technology are the clearest answers at hand.</p>
